abstract: "Evolutionary trade-offs among demographic parameters are important
  determinants of life-history evolution. Investigating such trade-offs under
  natural conditions has been limited by inappropriate analytical methods that
  fail to address the bias in demographic estimates that can result when issues
  of detection (uncertain detection of individual) are ignored. We propose a new
  statistical approach to quantify evolutionary trade-offs in wild populations.
  Our method is based on a state-space modeling framework that focuses on both
  the demographic process of interest as well as the observation process. As a
  case study, we used individual mark–recapture data for stream-dwelling
  Atlantic salmon juveniles in the Scorff River (Southern Brittany, France). In
  freshwater, juveniles face two life-history choices: migration to the ocean
  and sexual maturation (for males). Trade-offs may appear with these
  life-history choices and survival, because all are energy dependent. We found
  a cost of reproduction on survival for fish staying in freshwater and a
  survival advantage associated with the “decision” to migrate. Our modeling
  framework opens up promising prospects for the study of evolutionary
  trade-offs when some life-history traits are not, or only partially,
  observable."
