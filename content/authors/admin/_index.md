My primary research goals are directed toward investigating *eco-evolutionary dynamics* and the impacts on climate change on salmonid species.

I am particularly interested in *life history evolution*, *dispersal strategies* and associated *evolutionary processes* in the wild such as selective survival, evolutionary trade-offs (e.g., cost of reproduction) and phenotypic plasticity (e.g., conditional strategies).  

I like confronting theories and concepts in evolutionary biology with observational data through appropriate statistical tools. For that purpose, I use Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (state-space modeling, structural equation modeling, and quantitative genetics methods).

I also develop demo-genetic Individual-Based Model to investigate the potential responses of salmonid populations to climate change and selective exploitation, and  explore management strategies to foster the adaptation and resilience of these natural ressources.
